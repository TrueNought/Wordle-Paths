# Wordle-Paths
A "reverse Wordle solver" that identifies all the possible word combination paths that the user could have taken in order to arrive at the solution word, based on the positions of coloured tiles. 

This program takes the solution word as the first line of the input, followed by the positions of green or yellow letters in text format.
